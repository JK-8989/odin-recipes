    <p>
      It's really hard to resist such a quick dish of stir-fried eggs and juicy
      tomatoes.
    </p>
    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 to 6 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 scallion, white and green parts chopped and separated</li>
      <li>2 medium tomatoes, sliced into then wedges</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a wok or large skillet over high heat until a drop of water sizzles
        and evaporates on contact. Add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the
        base. Pour in the eggs and cook undisturbed until a thin layer forms on
        the bottom, about 30 to 60 seconds, then scramble the eggs until they
        are cooked but still light and fluffy. Season to taste with salt and
        pepper (I find 1/4 teaspoon salt is good to start.) Scoop out the eggs
        onto a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        In the same pan, add the scallions whites and stir-fry until just
        aromatic, about 20 seconds. Add the tomatoes and cook for 1 to 2
        minutes, until the juices start to release and the tomatoes wedges are
        slightly softened but still intact. Sprinkle sugar over the tomatoes.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        Return the eggs to the pan and heat for another minute, stirring so they
        are well-mixed with the tomatoes. Transfer to a serving dish and add the
        scallion greens on top.
      </li>
