    <p>These are the eggs you probably grew up eating: quick, easy to make, homey, and comforting. A little butter adds richness. We use just a tiny amount of salt here, because it's easy to oversalt eggs. Pull them from the heat the instant they're done so they don't turn tough and rubbery. And as with all egg dishes, dig in right away--they're not getting any better as they cool off.</p>
  <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1 teaspoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Melt your butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high until it gets bubbly; diner-style scrambles do not fear heat.</li><br>
    <li>While butter melts, break eggs into a small bowl. Use a fork to beat them like they owe you money until completely blended and slightly frothy. Stir in the pepper and salt.</li><br>
    <li>Add egg mixture to pan; start pulling the eggs from the sides of the pan into the middle (the edges cook faster than the center). Big, fluffy curds will start to form--exactly what you want. Keep it up, pulling the eggs from around the pan for about 3 minutes. The second all the runny egg is fully set--there's an eggshell-thin line between fluffy, firm eggs and tough, dry ones--pull the pan from the heat and slide the eggs onto your plate.</li><br>
